## Prerequisites

To build an app for the platform it is assumed that you have some basic knowledge of [React](https://react.dev/) and that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

## Scaffolding an App

To create a new app you can use the following command to create an app

```sh title="generate app"
pnpm create @coat-rack/app
```
Thereafter, you will be asked to enter a name for your app, a new app will be created for you.

An app will then be created in the directory for your app name. Next, move into this directory with `cd <your app name>`

Next, you will need to install the dependencies for your app, this can be done as follows:

```sh title="install dependencies"
pnpm install
```

The created app will contain the following:

<FileTree>

- my-app
  - src
    - **index.tsx** - app entrypoint
    - **styles.css** - app styles
  - public
    - **manifest.json** - app metadata
  - **package.json**
  - postcss.config.js
  - tailwind.config.ts - config for app styles
  - tsconfig.json
  - vite.config.ts - build config for application

</FileTree>

Most of the generated files are to configure the application, the main files that you will work with are `index.tsx`, `styles.csgs`, and `manifest.json` files

## Developing

Running the application in dev mode consists of running the following two commands:

1. `pnpm watch` to run build the app whenever the source files change
2. `pnpm serve` host the compiled app so it installed on the Coat Rack instance

Once the dev server is running, a message will be logged via the `pnpm serve` process indicating what the **Network** address of the app is. Using this URL, the app can then be installed via the App installation on Coat Rack

## App Entrypoint

The entrypoint for your application is the `index.tsx` file - this file will be compiled into the module that is loaded to run your application. Apps in Coat Rack are defined as follows:

```tsx title="src/index.tsx"
import { App, ProvideAppContext } from "@coat-rack/sdk"
import { Button } from "@coat-rack/ui/components/button"

import "./styles.css"  

export const MyApp: App = {
  /**
   *  The Entrypoint for the app
   */
  Entry: ({context}) => {
    return (
      <ProvideAppContext {...context}>
        <h1 className="bg-red-500">Hello my-app</h1>
        <Button>Click Me</Button>
      </ProvideAppContext>
    )
  },
}

export default MyApp 
```

An `App` is defined as an object with an `Entry` property. The `Entry` here is a react component that is provided with the `context` prop.

:::note
Important functionality related to working with the platform are exported from the `@coat-rack/sdk` package

## App Context

The `context` prop provided to the `ProvideAppContext` in order to make it possible to work with the app context in other places, for example if we were to query the database from a component:

```tsx title="src/example-component.tsx"
import { DbRecord, ProvideSpace, useAppContext } from "@coat-rack/sdk"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

interface AppData {
  name: string
  age: number
}

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const context = useAppContext<AppData>()
  const [data, setData] = useState<DbRecord<AppData>[]>()

  useEffect(() => {
    context.db.query({}).then((users) => setData(users))
  })

  return (
    <ul>
      {data?.map((d) => (
        <ProvideSpace key={d.id} space={d.space}>
          <li className="text-primary">{d.data.name}</li>
        </ProvideSpace>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Additionally, `ProvideSpace` allows us to respect the space that a data entry belongs to, this means that any styles needed within the a segment of the UI will match the space in which the database record exists
