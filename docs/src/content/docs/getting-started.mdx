import { LinkButton, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

## Prerequisites

The following are necessary to run the application:

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or an equivalent tool

It is assumed that you're familiar with Docker and Docker Compose and have a basic understanding of the how application hosting works within your server's environment

## Running with Docker

### Using the Compose Stack

The application is intended to be deployed and distributed using Docker Compose. The relevant files for hosting the application can be downloaded below:

<LinkButton icon="download" href="../coat-rack-docker-compose.zip">
  Download Docker Compose Files
</LinkButton>

Once downloaded you will need to unzip the folder. The from within the folder, run the following command:

```sh
HOST_DOMAIN=<your server domain> docker compose up
```

> Note that the `HOST_DOMAIN` variable needs to be the domain for accessing your host server and is the domain that your application will be accessed from outside of your network

### Compose Stack Overview

The Compose stack consists of the following files:

<FileTree>

- coat-rack-docker-compose
  - Dockerfile - image defintion for running coat-rack
  - Caddyfile - reverse proxy configuration for stack
  - docker-compose.yml - composes the above files into the app stack

</FileTree>

Additionally, it exposes the volumes `coatrack_data` and `caddy_data`. The `coatrack_data` volume is where all your Coat Rack data lives
