Coat Rack is a platform that provides users with the necessary tools to own and share their data within their physical space. Enabling non-technical users to take control of their data ownership is the foundation on which the platform is built.

This enables users to take their daily utilities off the cloud and move their data to something they own while providing a user experience that is on par with that of cloud-based applications.

## Core Principles

- Enable non-technical users to take ownership of their data
- Allow users to store their data anywhere they want
- Seamless data organisation and sharing within a physical location
- Applications can work when offline
- Safe and easy installation of 1st and 3rd party apps
